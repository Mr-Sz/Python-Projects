# My Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have worked on. Each project is stored in its own directory, along with any necessary files or documentation.

Currently, this repository contains **8** Python projects/scripts.

## Projects

- [BlackJack Game:](./blackjack_game/): This is a simple 1-player Blackjack game created using Python and designed to run in the Windows Terminal. The game was created by ME as my 2nd milestone python-project for Pierian Data Complete Python3 Bootcamp to improve my understanding of classes/objects.
- [Webscrapers:](./webscrapers/): This directory contains all my web scraping projects.
- [Txt to Sql Code App:](./txt_to_sql/): Discover seamless natural language to SQL translation with my Txt to SQL Code App, powered by OpenAI's advanced language processing
- [Mini Projects:](./mini_projects/): All my beginner-level python projects (small projects I make to revise my python skills are kept here).

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Each project may also have its own specific requirements, which are listed in their respective README file.
