# My Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have worked on. Each project is stored in its own directory, along with any necessary files or documentation.

## Projects

- [BlackJack Game:](./blackjack_game/): This is a simple 1-player Blackjack game created using Python and designed to run in the Windows Terminal. The game was created by Sz as their 2nd milestone python-project for Pierian Data Complete Python3 Bootcamp to improve their understanding of classes/objects.
- [TimesJob Webscraper:](./timesjob_webscraper/): This Python script scrapes job listings from the TimesJobs website and filters out the ones that require skills that the user is not familiar with.
- [Mini Projects:](./mini_projects/): All Beginner Level python projects are present there.

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Each project may also have its own specific requirements, which are listed in its README file.
