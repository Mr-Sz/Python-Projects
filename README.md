# My Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have worked on. Each project is stored in its own directory, along with any necessary files or documentation.

## Projects

- [BlackJack Game:](./blackjack_game/): This is a simple 1-player Blackjack game created using Python and designed to run in the Windows Terminal. The game was created by ME as my 2nd milestone python-project for Pierian Data Complete Python3 Bootcamp to improve my understanding of classes/objects.
- [TimesJob Webscraper:](./timesjob_webscraper/): This Python script scrapes job listings from the TimesJobs website and filters out the ones that require skills that the user is not familiar with.
- [IMDb Top 250 Movies Scraper:](./imdb_webscraper/): This Python script scrapes the top 250 movies from IMDb and saves the data to an Excel spreadsheet.
- [Mini Projects:](./mini_projects/): All my beginner-level python projects (small projects I make to revise my python skills are kept here).

## Getting Started

To run any of the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Each project may also have its own specific requirements, which are listed in their respective README file.
