# My Beginner Practice Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that I worked on while learning and revising Python. Each project is stored in its own directory within this repository, along with any necessary files or documentation.

Currently, this repository contains **4** Python mini projects.

## Projects

- [Web Scrapers:](./webscrapers/): This directory contains my web scraping projects where I explore data on the web using Python.
- [Antipode Locator:](./antipode_locator/): Discover the exact opposite location on Earth with this simple Python application.
- [Tic Tac Toe Game:](./TicTacToe_game/): Play the classic Tic Tac Toe game against a computer opponent implemented in Python.
- [War Card Game:](./war_card_game/): Experience the excitement of the War card game in this Python implementation.

## Getting Started

To run any of these mini projects, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. Each project may also have its own specific requirements, which are listed in their respective README files within their respective directories.

Feel free to explore and enjoy these beginner-level Python projects!
